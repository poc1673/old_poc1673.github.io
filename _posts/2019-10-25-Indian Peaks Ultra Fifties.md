# Ultra in Retrospective: Indian Creek Fifties

Last Saturday I finished my first trail ultra - the Indian Creek Fifties just south of Denver. Finishing was nothing short of exhilarating, but the race was a slog for me.

I capped off my training with a 24 mile trail run followed by a 29 mile road run the day week later. I tapered for three weeks before the run. Despite the prep, I was unprepared for how steep the training was. The race had more than 8,000 feet of elevation gain over 34 miles while my hardest run was a marathon with 5,400 feet elevation gain.

Alone, this would make the race a challenge, but on top of that I didn't have the discipline to keep myself from pacing with the people running the 15 mile race. By mile 14 I felt like I was done and begun race walking while I planned to quit at the next aid station. I mentioned this to another 55K runner who was *emphatic* that I not quit:

> You've ran 15 miles! 19 miles is *nothing*! Keep going!

With that bit of encouragement, I got to the aid station, resupplied, and started off onto my second loop. Getting the encouragement didn't change anything - I was still tired. Despite that, I was still able to keep up a decent pace until my left knee started bothering me around mile 20. From there I resorted to running until my knee began paining me at which point I would resort to walking for a short period of time.

Did I finish? Yes, absolutely. I came well under the necessary time. But this race has me serious reconsidering my training plans for the future. I need to incorporate more hill work and more quality time traveling on my feet.
