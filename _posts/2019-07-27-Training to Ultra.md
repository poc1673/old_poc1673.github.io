# Training to Ultra
![](https://github.com/poc1673/poc1673.github.io/blob/master/img/training_for_ultra/DSC_0052.JPG)
I began training for ultra-running after I moved to Pittsburgh a couple of years ago. I've only managed to get one race under my belt so far (the new defunct Lt. JC Stone 50K in North Park). Since I've moved to Denver, it's taken me some time to get back into "running shape"; it took me nearly a month to acclimatize to the elevation here.

Now, I finally feel ready to throw my hat into a new race: The 55K [Estes epic](http://estesepic.com).

Trail-races seem similar to a marathon (in that they require running a long distance) but require a different set of skills from runners. The parts of training that have jumped out to me are:

1. Trail training vs. road training
2. Balancing training load
3. Ensuring diet and other lifestyle factors remain in balance

### Trails vs Roads

It's easy to take the difference between a country trail and a city road for granted. However, the repetition repetitive shock of running on a sidewalk exacerbates any aches or pains you may already have. On the other hand, trails have less impact but make you slow down and demand a degree of attention to the uneven ground.

Denver is a great place to prepare for this though - I've been aiming at taking two trips out to local trails like the North trail loop for my long runs. This last Saturday I completed a trail marathon on the North table loop which was a completely different animal from running the same distance in the city.

Hiking has also been fantastic cross training.

## Training load
One of the first mistakes I made when I started training was assuming that preparation involved an increase in mileage - that's all.

An ultra requires more training but there isn't a 1-to-1 correspondence between race mileage. The majority of the training mileage stays the same with the major change being a single distance run which emphasizes time and difficulty over raw distance. [This 50K training plan](https://blog.mapmyrun.com/50k-trail-running-training-plan/) has you peak at 22 miles a couple of weeks before the race. The training recommendations from [Training Essentials for Ultrarunning](https://www.amazon.com/Training-Essentials-Ultrarunning-Ultramarathon-Performance-ebook/dp/B01GQRFZS2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1E5CIN0A118L5&keywords=training+essentials+for+ultrarunning&qid=1564322753&s=gateway&sprefix=training+essentials%2Caps%2C175&sr=8-1) makes similar recommendations.

While there is a step up in mileage, similarity in training area, the pace and timing of the run, and the ability to handle the logistics well are all just as important. Part of my training has simply been running with a backpack full of supplies, eating while running.

## Life balance

Finally, the time requirement that preparing for these events exacts a toll that other items in life. I have an exciting job as a data scientist, a beautiful girlfriend, and plenty of miscellanea that which I need to dedicate myself to.

Thankfully, I'm also type-A and planning ahead is second-nature to me. Getting up early and just pushing myself to complete my longer runs frees up the rest of the day to do more productive things. I also find ways to squeeze running and cross-training into my day. When I get out of work  - I run home.
When I get up on rest days, I stretch. I can also mix things in with running to make sure that I get more out of them. For instance, using Audible has helped keep my training productive for more than just my mind.

I'll post from time to time to describe my progress. If all goes well, I plan on doing a 50 mile before winter hits the Rockies!
