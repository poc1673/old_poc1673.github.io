# Cliff Notes:

 I'm a quantitative financial analyst working in Denver, Colorado. I love creative problem solving and believe scientific computing is a powerful tool to investigate our problems, propose a solution, and impelement it. Finance is a prime area to study this.

 When I'm not huddled at my desk drinking coffee, I train for trail races. I'm also a "fan of history" and enjoy spending an afternoon with a book.
